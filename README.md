## Just Minimal Green VSCode theme

Just a theme that I created to match my window manager, it turned out pretty nice so I figured I could share it with the world.

### Notes

There are likely some issues with the syntax highlighting in languages that I don't normally use. If you come across these, feel free to submit a PR so that I can merge them in.

### Credits

Thank you to the random themes on github that I was able to build the syntax highlighting from.
